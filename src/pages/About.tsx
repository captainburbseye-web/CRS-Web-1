      {/* THE CRS STORY */}

        <h3 class="content-heading heading">The CRS Story</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            Cowley Road Studios was founded on a simple premise: <strong>professional infrastructure shouldn't be a luxury</strong>.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            Oxford's creative community needed recording facilities, rehearsal space, and technical support that worked reliably — not aspirational branding or fragile setups. We built CRS to prioritise engineering reality, documentation, and predictable outcomes.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            We began with a single recording room and a commitment to system discipline: signal paths mapped, equipment tested, and decisions made on function rather than fashion.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            Today, CRS operates across two Oxford locations — <strong>Cowley Road</strong> and <strong>Cricket Road</strong> — providing studio recording, rehearsal space, live sound services, and community venue access. We support grassroots artists, community organisations, and professional projects using the same operational standard.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            The mission remains unchanged: <strong>make professional-grade creative infrastructure accessible, reliable, and sustainable</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* THE NO CHAOS POLICY */}

        <h3 class="content-heading heading">The No Chaos Policy</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            CRS operates under a strict <strong>No Chaos Policy</strong>. This is not a slogan — it is an operational baseline.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Equipment Maintenance</strong><br/>
            All equipment is tested, maintained, and documented. If it is in use, it works.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Signal Path Documentation</strong><br/>
            Studios, PA systems, and installations are fully documented. No undocumented routing. No guesswork.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Engineering-Led Decisions</strong><br/>
            Systems and workflows are chosen for reliability and suitability, not trends or brand allegiance.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Predictable Results</strong><br/>
            Sessions and events are designed to start on time and run without technical distraction.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Systematic Problem Solving</strong><br/>
            When issues arise, they are resolved methodically, documented, and prevented from recurring.
